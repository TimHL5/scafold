[Hook — look directly at camera, slight pause before speaking] "$45 billion dollars has been invested in AI tools that help you build faster."

[Beat] "Code faster. Design faster. Ship faster."

[Lean in slightly] "Zero dollars has been invested in helping you figure out if what you're building is worth building in the first place."

[Shift tone — more conversational] "Think about that. We gave the entire world a factory — and nobody's asking what the factory should produce."

[Gesture with hands] "I've spent 3 years helping 500 people across 7 countries turn ideas into products. And the number one reason people fail isn't bad code. It isn't bad design. It's solving a problem that nobody actually has."

[Slight smile] "My co-founder Dylan and I are building something that fixes that. It starts with one question. And we're opening the waitlist this week."

Every dollar has gone to building faster. Code faster. Ship faster. Design faster. Deploy faster.

Zero dollars have gone to building the right thing.

This isn't a gap. It's an industry-wide assumption that's costing millions of people months of wasted effort.

I've started 3 companies. The first two failed — not because we couldn't build. Because we built solutions to problems that didn't exist.

Tim and I spent 3 years fixing this. We created a system — tested on 500+ people across 7 countries — that starts before the building. It starts with one question: what frustrates you?

Not your idea. Your frustration. Because frustration is honest. Ideas are performative.

We're opening the waitlist this week at scafold.ai.

First 10,000 get founding member access.

Two of my three companies failed. Both started with ideas. The one that's working? Started with frustration.

Tim and I spent 3 years studying this pattern across 500+ people in 7 countries. The correlation is overwhelming: the more frustrated someone is about a problem, the more likely they are to build something people actually want.

This week we're opening the waitlist for something that captures frustration at scale and turns it into validated opportunity.

No ChatGPT validation theater. Real data from real humans.

A language model optimized for agreeableness cannot perform market validation. It can't tell you if real humans have the problem you're solving. It can't assess willingness to pay. It can't identify competitive dynamics with actual commercial judgment.

It can tell you what you want to hear.

We built Scafold to tell you what you need to hear.

3 years. 500+ people. 7 countries. A frustration-to-execution pipeline that starts with the question ChatGPT never asks: does anyone actually have this problem?

Until now.

Uber started because Travis was frustrated about getting a cab. Airbnb started because Brian and Joe couldn't afford a hotel. Slack started because Stewart's team email was a disaster.

The frustration came first. The billion-dollar company came second. Every single time.

Tim and I built a system that starts at the frustration. Captures it. Validates it. Maps the market. Finds the gap. Designs the solution.

The frustrations people are submitting aren't what we expected.

They're not "I wish there was an app for X." They're raw. Personal. Specific.

"I've called 30 therapists. None take my insurance."
"My meal prep fails every Wednesday."
"I make $85K and genuinely don't know if I'm saving enough."
"Group projects in college are broken and nobody cares."

These aren't startup ideas. These are product briefs — written by the exact people who would pay for the solution.

Every one of these frustrations maps to a market gap:
- Mental health access → $280B market
- Meal planning adherence → $4.2B opportunity
- Personal finance clarity → $12B gap
- EdTech collaboration → $8B play

This is what Scafold does. We take the most honest data on Earth — human frustration — and show you the business hiding inside.

Most people think they're submitting complaints. They're actually submitting product briefs.

Here's the pattern we're seeing:

The best frustrations aren't abstract. They're specific. They include failed attempts. They reveal willingness to pay.

"I've tried 4 meal prep apps. None account for the fact that my schedule changes weekly."

That sentence contains: a defined problem, evidence of existing solution failure, frequency data, and implicit willingness to try alternatives.

That's not a complaint. That's a market signal.

We're building the infrastructure to capture these signals at scale. And every day the dataset gets richer.

The waitlist is open. scafold.ai.
