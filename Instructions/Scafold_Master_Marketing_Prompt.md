## COMPANY OVERVIEW

**Company:** Scafold (one f)
**Website:** scafold.ai
**Founders:** Tim Liu (CFO) & Dylan Kim (CEO)
**Product:** AI-powered frustration-to-execution pipeline
**Thesis:** AI can build anything. It can't tell you what's worth building. Scafold can.

**Key Stats:**
- 500+ people guided across 7 countries
- $50K in revenue from manual process
- 3 years of iteration
- Applying to Y Combinator S26

**What Scafold Does:**
1. You tell us what frustrates you
2. We identify if it's a real problem
3. We find who else has this problem
4. We map what solutions exist (and why they fail)
5. We design something better
6. We give you the blueprint to build it

Most AI tools start at step 6. We start at step 1.

**The Frustration Page (scafold.ai):**
- Simple landing page: type your frustration + join waitlist
- No mini-analysis response, no friction
- Every submission becomes proprietary data
- Primary metrics: waitlist signups + frustrations collected

### WEEK 0: PRE-LAUNCH (Feb 22-28)

---

**POST #1 — Saturday Feb 22 — LinkedIn (Tim) — The Teaser**

Zero downloads.

That's what a student I mentored got after spending 3 months building a "smart grocery list" app. Beautiful code. Elegant UI. AI-powered everything.

Nobody wanted it.

He never asked a single person if they needed it. He asked ChatGPT instead. ChatGPT said "great idea." He believed it.

I've spent 3 years helping 500+ students across 7 countries turn ideas into real products. The pattern is always the same:

The idea doesn't kill you. The assumption does.

Every successful product I've seen started the exact same way — someone was genuinely pissed off about something. Not "I think there's a market opportunity." Just: "this is broken and it makes my life worse."

ChatGPT can write your code. Cursor can build your app. Replit can ship it tonight.

But none of them can tell you if anyone actually cares.

We've been working on something for 3 years that can.

More next week.

#buildinpublic #startups #AI

**POST #2 — Sunday Feb 23 — LinkedIn (Dylan) — The Co-Founder Tease**

I've started 3 companies. Two of them failed.

Not because the tech was bad. Not because we couldn't ship. Not because we ran out of runway.

They failed because we solved problems that didn't exist.

We'd get excited about an idea. Ask ChatGPT for validation. It would say "promising market opportunity" with a straight face. We'd build for months.

Then we'd launch to silence.

The hardest lesson in startups isn't learning to build. It's learning to listen.

3 years ago, Tim and I decided to stop guessing. We built a system — tested it on 500+ people across 7 countries — that starts with one thing every person on Earth has in common:

Frustration.

Something's coming next week. It starts with one question.

#entrepreneurship #startups #AI

---

**POST #3 — Monday Feb 24 — LinkedIn (Scafold) — The Manifesto**

$45 billion.

That's how much has been invested in AI tools that help you build faster.

Code faster. Design faster. Deploy faster. Ship faster.

$0 has been invested in helping you figure out what's actually worth building.

Think about that.

We have mass-produced the ability to create. We've done nothing about the ability to choose.

AI can build anything.

It can't tell you what's worth building.

That's about to change.

We're Scafold. We have one question for you.

Coming this week.

**POST #5 — Tuesday Feb 25 — LinkedIn (Tim) — The Problem**

A student I mentored last year built a "smart grocery list" app.

3 months of work. Beautiful UI. AI-powered suggestions. Clean code.

Launch day: zero downloads. Zero.

Not because the product was bad. Because nobody asked for it.

He validated the idea the way most people do — he asked ChatGPT. ChatGPT said "this has strong market potential." It generated a TAM analysis, competitor overview, and go-to-market strategy. All made up. All encouraging.

He built a solution to a problem he imagined.

This happens thousands of times a day. Smart, capable people. Building beautiful products. For markets that don't exist.

The problem isn't building. AI solved building.

The problem is knowing what to build.

That's an entirely different skill. And nobody's built a tool for it.

Until now.

Tomorrow I'll show you what we've been working on.

---

**POST #6 — Wednesday Feb 26 — LinkedIn (Scafold) — The Countdown**

Nobody is asking you the most important question.

Not your professor. Not your investor. Not your AI assistant.

The question:

What bugs you?

Not "what's your startup idea." Not "what market do you want to disrupt." Not "describe your value proposition."

Just: what genuinely frustrates you about your daily life?

Your answer is worth more than you think.

Thursday. scafold.ai.

**POST #8 — Thursday Feb 27 — LinkedIn (Dylan) — The Data Hook**

8 billion people wake up every morning frustrated about something.

74% of Americans report chronic stress about at least one major area — money, health, work, relationships. That's not a survey insight. That's an untapped market of billions.

And yet: no structured way exists to turn that frustration into something useful.

No tool asks: "You're frustrated about X. Let's figure out if it's a real problem, who else has it, what solutions already exist, why they're failing, and what you could actually build."

That tool didn't exist. So Tim and I built it.

3 years. 500+ people. 7 countries. $50K in revenue from a completely manual process.

Tomorrow, we open it to everyone.

scafold.ai — go there tomorrow morning.

---

**POST #9 — Friday Feb 28 — LinkedIn (Tim) — The Eve-of-Launch**

Tomorrow morning, we go live.

3 years of work comes down to one question.

Not "what's your startup idea?" Not "describe your business model." Not "how big is your TAM?"

Just: what bugs you?

We built a platform that takes your frustration — the real, messy, personal kind — and turns it into something actionable. A validated problem. A real market. A solution blueprint.

500+ people have gone through this process across 7 countries. $50K in revenue. Tomorrow, everyone gets access.

It starts at scafold.ai.

Tell us what bugs you. We'll show you what it's worth.

See you in the morning.

### WEEK 1: LAUNCH WEEK (Mar 1-7)

---

**POST #11 — Saturday Mar 1 — LinkedIn (Tim) — The Launch (8:00 AM ET)**

It's live.

scafold.ai

Here's the deal: go there and tell us what frustrates you. That's it.

Not your startup idea. Not your elevator pitch. Not your business plan.

Just: what bugs you?

"I can't find a therapist who takes my insurance."
"Hiring contractors wastes 40% of my budget."
"My gym app is absolute garbage."
"I spend 3 hours meal prepping and still order DoorDash by Wednesday."

Every frustration is an unsolved problem.
Every unsolved problem is a market.
Every market is a company waiting to be built.

Most people can't see that. Scafold can.

We take your frustration and run it through a structured pipeline — problem identification, target audience, competitive mapping, solution design, execution plan.

You tell us what pisses you off. We tell you what to build.

3 years. 500+ people. 7 countries. $50K in revenue.

Today, we open the door.

**POST #12 — Saturday Mar 1 — LinkedIn (Dylan) — The Product Story (8:30 AM ET)**

We just launched Scafold. Here's what it does in 30 seconds:

1. You tell us what frustrates you
2. We determine if it's a real problem or just a bad day
3. We find who else has this exact pain
4. We map every existing solution and why they're failing
5. We design something better
6. We hand you the blueprint to build it

Most AI tools start at step 6.

We start at step 1.

That's the difference between building fast and building right. Between shipping a product nobody wants and shipping one people are desperate for.

3 years of doing this manually for 500+ people taught us something: the frustration IS the idea. Everything else is execution.

Go tell us what bugs you → scafold.ai

#WhatBugsYou #scafold

**POST #13 — Saturday Mar 1 — LinkedIn (Scafold) — The Brand Launch (9:00 AM ET)**

What bugs you?

That's all we want to know.

Not your pitch. Not your plan. Not your credentials.

Just: what frustrates you about the world?

Go to scafold.ai and tell us. Takes 30 seconds.

We'll take your frustration and show you what it's worth.

Because here's the thing nobody tells you:

Everyone complains. Nobody gets paid for it.

Until now.

**POST #15 — Sunday Mar 2 — LinkedIn (Tim) — First Results**

24 hours ago we launched Scafold.

Here's what happened:

→ [X] people told us what bugs them
→ Top frustration category: [real data]
→ Most unexpected submission: [real data]
→ Countries represented: [real data]

But here's what surprised me most: people aren't sharing startup ideas.

They're sharing real pain.

"I can't find a dentist who doesn't try to upsell me on veneers."
"My landlord takes 3 weeks to fix anything."
"Group projects in college are fundamentally broken."

These aren't complaints. They're $100M+ problems hiding in plain sight.

Every single person who complains about something is identifying a market gap they don't know exists.

That's why we built Scafold. Not for founders with decks. For anyone who's ever been frustrated and thought "someone should fix this."

You ARE the someone.

**POST #17 — Monday Mar 3 — LinkedIn (Scafold) — Frustration of the Day #1**

FRUSTRATION OF THE DAY:

"I spend 3 hours every Sunday meal prepping and still end up ordering DoorDash by Wednesday."

You might read that and think: willpower problem.

We read it and see: a $4.2 billion market gap.

Here's what Scafold's pipeline found:

THE PROBLEM: Meal prep is designed for nutrition. Not for the reality that by Wednesday, you're exhausted, your schedule shifted, and chicken breast sounds revolting.

THE OPPORTUNITY: An AI meal system that adapts in real-time — swapping recipes when your schedule changes, your energy drops, or your fridge gets raided.

THE MARKET: 68% of Americans say they want to eat healthier but can't stick to the plan. That's not a niche. That's a generation.

This is what happens when you treat frustration as data instead of noise.

What are you frustrated about?

The frustrations coming into scafold.ai are wild. Problems I'd never think to build for. Pain points that are simultaneously deeply personal and universally shared.

This is the data ChatGPT can't generate — real complaints from real people who aren't trying to sound smart. They're just mad about stuff.

That honesty is the whole product.

Building in public. More coming.

**POST #19 — Tuesday Mar 4 — LinkedIn (Dylan) — The Data Insight**

We've collected [X]+ frustrations in 4 days.

Here's what nobody — including us — expected:

The #1 frustration category isn't tech.
It isn't money.
It isn't career.

It's [real data — health/daily routines/relationships].

Why this matters: every VC-backed AI company is building for knowledge workers. Productivity tools. Workflow automation. Enterprise dashboards.

Meanwhile, the things that actually keep people up at night are things nobody's building for.

This is what proprietary data looks like:
→ Not scraped from Reddit
→ Not generated by GPT
→ Not purchased from a data broker

Real frustrations. From real people. Collected by asking one question.

Every data point is a product waiting to be built.

**POST #21 — Wednesday Mar 5 — LinkedIn (Scafold) — Frustration of the Day #2**

FRUSTRATION OF THE DAY:

"I can't find a therapist who takes my insurance and has availability within 2 weeks."

47 million Americans need mental health care. The average wait time? 48 days.

Here's what Scafold sees that most people miss:

PROBLEM: Insurance networks, availability calendars, and specialization matching exist in completely separate systems. You have to cross-reference them manually. While in crisis.

OPPORTUNITY: A unified matching engine — real-time cross-referencing of insurance, availability, specialization, patient preferences, and provider quality. One search. Instant results.

MARKET: $280B mental health market growing 5.1% annually. The matching layer alone could be a $2B+ opportunity.

Someone frustrated about finding a therapist just described a billion-dollar company.

**POST #22 — Wednesday Mar 5 — LinkedIn (Tim) — Building in Public Update**

Week 1 of Scafold. Real numbers. No vanity metrics.

[X] frustrations collected
[X] emails on waitlist
[X] countries represented
[X] social impressions

What's working:
→ "What bugs you?" is the strongest hook I've ever tested. People want to share frustrations more than they want to share ideas.
→ LinkedIn is outperforming every other channel by 3x
→ Real frustration data beats generic startup advice for engagement. Always.

What's not working:
→ TikTok format hasn't clicked yet. Testing new approaches this week.
→ Mobile experience on the page needs work. Bounce rate too high.

What's next:
→ "Frustration of the Day" goes daily starting today
→ First weekly trend report drops Friday
→ Campus ambassador program kicks off next week

Building in public means showing you the actual scoreboard. Here it is.

**POST #23 — Thursday Mar 6 — LinkedIn (Dylan) — The Technical Edge**

Every AI company is building copilots.

We're building something fundamentally different: commercial instinct.

Here's the difference:

A copilot executes your instructions faster. It writes code. Generates designs. Automates workflows. It does what you tell it to do.

Commercial instinct tells you whether you should be doing it at all.

It takes a frustration and asks the questions founders forget:
→ Is this a real problem or just a bad Tuesday?
→ How many people have this exact pain, right now?
→ What solutions exist and why are they failing?
→ Is this a company or just a feature?
→ What's the fastest path from pain to product?

You can't prompt-engineer this. It's not a template. It's a pipeline built on 500+ real interactions across 7 countries.

That's Scafold. Not another wrapper. The thing that tells you what's worth wrapping in the first place.

**POST #26 — Friday Mar 7 — LinkedIn (Tim) — Week 1 Reflection**

Week 1 is done. Honest reflection:

What surprised me: People aren't sharing "startup ideas." They're sharing visceral, personal frustrations. Health. Relationships. Boring daily annoyances that slowly ruin their quality of life. The rawness caught me off guard.

What I learned: The distance between "frustration" and "business" is way shorter than anyone thinks. Almost every personal complaint, when you dig two layers deep, reveals a market nobody's serving.

What scares me: We're sitting on the beginning of something with no ceiling. A dataset of structured human pain points that no other company has. No one's even trying to collect this. And we're just starting.

What I know: This is real. The data proves it. The engagement proves it. The submissions prove it.

Week 2 starts Monday. Daily "Frustration of the Day" series. Campus ambassador activation. More data, more signal, more proof.

If you haven't told us what bugs you yet → scafold.ai

See you Monday.

### WEEK 2: SUSTAIN PHASE (Mar 8-14)

**POST #27 — Monday Mar 8 — LinkedIn (Tim) — The YC Angle**

I just hit submit on our Y Combinator application.

The question that took me 3 hours to answer wasn't about metrics or product or team.

It was: "What do you understand that everyone else doesn't?"

Here's what I wrote:

"8 billion people are frustrated about something every single day. The $45B AI tooling market helps them build solutions faster — but nobody helps them figure out which problems are worth solving. We're building the world's first frustration-to-execution pipeline. Not for founders. For everyone. And our dataset of real human frustrations is a moat that gets stronger with every single submission."

Whether YC says yes or no doesn't change what we know:

The frustration is the starting point. Everything else — the idea, the product, the company — follows from there.

**POST #28 — Monday Mar 8 — LinkedIn (Scafold) — Frustration of the Day #3**

FRUSTRATION OF THE DAY:

"Group projects in college are the single worst part of my education."

Every student who's ever carried a team just felt that in their chest.

Here's what Scafold sees:

PROBLEM: Group projects have zero accountability infrastructure. Free riders face no consequences. The person doing 80% of the work gets the same grade as the person doing 5%. Professors know it. Students know it. Nobody's fixing it.

OPPORTUNITY: An academic collaboration platform with built-in contribution tracking, peer accountability scoring, and workload distribution — where the grade reflects the work.

MARKET: 20M+ US college students. $8B EdTech market. Every university has this problem. Zero have a real solution.

One frustrated student just described the next major EdTech company.

What's your frustration worth?

**POST #29 — Tuesday Mar 9 — LinkedIn (Dylan) — International Perspective**

We tested Scafold in 7 countries before launching in the US.

Hong Kong. Vietnam. Singapore. South Korea. And more.

Here's what nobody expected: frustrations don't have a passport.

A student in Ho Chi Minh City and a student in Boston are frustrated about the exact same things:
→ "I can't find a job that matches my actual skills"
→ "Healthcare is confusing and expensive"
→ "I waste hours on things that should be automated"

Different languages. Different economies. Different cultures.

Same pain.

That's why Scafold isn't a vertical tool. Frustration doesn't fit in a category. It doesn't have a demographic. It doesn't need a market segment.

It's just human.

8 billion people. 8 billion frustrations. One platform.

**POST #30 — Wednesday Mar 10 — LinkedIn (Scafold) — Frustration of the Day #4**

FRUSTRATION OF THE DAY:

"I make $85K a year and I genuinely cannot tell you if I'm saving enough to retire."

The personal finance industry is a $12 billion market. And it's failing the average person.

Here's what Scafold sees:

PROBLEM: Financial tools either oversimplify (save 20% of your income — thanks, very helpful) or drown you in complexity (here's a dashboard with 47 features you'll use twice). Nobody meets you where you actually are: anxious and confused.

OPPORTUNITY: An AI financial companion that starts with your specific anxiety — not a generic risk assessment — and builds an adaptive plan from there.

KEY INSIGHT: The entry point isn't "financial planning." It's "I'm stressed about money." Meet people at the frustration, not the solution.

That's the Scafold thesis. Start with the pain. End with the plan.

People keep asking: "Aren't you scared?"

More scared of not trying.

The data we're collecting at scafold.ai is unlike anything — real frustrations from real people, not generated, not scraped.

What bugs you? Tell us. Link in bio.

**POST #32 — Thursday Mar 11 — LinkedIn (Tim) — The PwC Decision Narrative**

I have a signed offer from PwC Technology Consulting.

I also have a company with 500+ users, $50K revenue, and a proprietary dataset no competitor can touch.

Here's the decision tree in my head:

Path A: Take PwC. Learn consulting. Build a resume. Start something "eventually." Play it safe.

Path B: Go all-in on Scafold. Apply to YC. Bet on the data. Bet on myself. Risk everything.

Here's what nobody talks about: you don't have to choose.

I'm not dropping out. I'm not burning the PwC bridge. I'm building something real while keeping my floor intact.

And that's actually Scafold's whole philosophy.

We don't tell people to quit their jobs and start companies. We say: what bugs you? Then we figure out if it's worth your time.

Sometimes the answer is "quit everything and build this." Sometimes it's "keep your job, but here's a $500/month side project that solves a real problem."

Both are valid. Both start with the same question.

**POST #33 — Friday Mar 12 — LinkedIn (Scafold) — Weekly Frustration Report**

SCAFOLD WEEKLY FRUSTRATION REPORT — Week 2

[X]+ total frustrations collected. Here's what's new:

TRENDING UP:
→ [Category] frustrations increased [X]% from last week
→ [Category] cracked the top 5 for the first time

MOST SUBMITTED: "[actual submission]"
MOST BUILDABLE: "[actual submission]" — estimated [X]M addressable market

SIGNALS:
→ [X] new countries represented
→ Average frustration length: [X] words (people are getting more specific)
→ [X]% of submissions reference a product that's already failing them

The dataset gets more valuable every week. Your frustration makes it stronger.

### WEEKS 3-4: SCALE PHASE (Mar 15-28)

---

**POST #34 — Week 3/4 — LinkedIn (Tim) — The Numbers Post**

30 days of Scafold. Real numbers:

[X] frustrations collected
[X] waitlist signups
[X] countries
[X] unique problem categories identified
[X]M+ social impressions
[X] campus ambassadors active

But here's what the metrics can't capture:

→ The student who submitted "I can't afford textbooks" — and realized she was describing a $10B problem nobody's solving well
→ The small business owner who said "hiring is broken" — and now has a blueprint for a recruiting tool
→ The 47 separate people who submitted variations of "I can't find a therapist"

When 47 strangers independently describe the same pain, that's not a complaint.

That's a market screaming for a solution.

The data is the moat. And every day it gets deeper.

If you haven't told us what bugs you yet, you're sitting on an insight you don't know you have.

**POST #35 — Week 3/4 — LinkedIn (Dylan) — The Moat Post**

Every founder talks about moats. Most of them don't have one.

Here's ours:

Day 1: Zero frustrations in our database.
Day 30: [X]+ structured, categorized, real human pain points that no other company on the planet has.

This data can't be:
→ Scraped from Reddit (it doesn't exist there)
→ Generated by GPT (it's not trained on this)
→ Purchased from a broker (nobody collects it)
→ Replicated by a competitor (it took 3 years and earned community trust)

Every new submission makes the dataset smarter. Every smarter dataset makes the AI better. Every better AI makes each submission more valuable.

That's not a product. That's a flywheel.

And it's spinning faster every week.

**POST #36 — Week 3/4 — LinkedIn (Scafold) — Challenge Post**

Drop your biggest daily frustration in the comments.

Rules: No startup jargon. No "I think there's an opportunity in..." No pitch-speak.

Just: what genuinely annoys you about your everyday life?

We'll pick 3 from the comments and show exactly how Scafold would break each one down — the problem, the market size, the competitive landscape, and the execution blueprint.

Your complaint might be a company.

Let's find out.

**POST #37 — Week 3/4 — LinkedIn (Tim) — The Senior Year Post**

Typical BC senior spring: job apps, formals, senior week, coasting to graduation.

My senior spring: applying to Y Combinator, building an AI company, reading frustration data at 2am, and drinking way too much Hillside coffee.

I'm not saying this to flex. I'm saying it because 12 months ago, "entrepreneur" was a line on my resume. Not something I actually was.

What changed: I realized the skills I've been learning for 4 years — financial modeling, market analysis, user research — weren't designed for PowerPoint presentations.

They were designed for this.

Scafold started as an experiment: "can we help people validate ideas?" It became something much bigger: a platform that turns the universal human experience of being frustrated into structured, actionable solutions.

I'm terrified. I'm energized. I'm running on 4 hours of sleep.

I've never been more alive.

If you're in college and you're sitting on an idea: don't wait for the "right time." Start with what bugs you.

## ADDITIONAL LINKEDIN POST IDEAS (Scafold Brand)

These are additional post concepts with hooks. Use when you need fresh content beyond the 37 scheduled posts.

**Contrarian Post:** "Stop asking ChatGPT if your startup idea is good. It will always say yes. It's a language model optimized for helpfulness, not honesty. It can't tell you if real people have this problem. It can't validate willingness to pay. It can't map the competitive landscape with actual commercial judgment. We built something that can. It starts with one question."

**Data Post:** "We collected 500+ frustrations from real people in 72 hours. Here's what surprised us: 34% are about work/career (not what we expected). 22% are about health/wellness. 18% are about money. The remaining 26% are things nobody is building for. The data is the moat."

**Manifesto Post:** "8 billion people on Earth. Every single one of them has frustrations. Zero of them have a structured way to turn those frustrations into solutions. Until now."

**Social Proof Post:** "500+ students. 7 countries. $50K in revenue. 3 years. And it started because Tim and I were frustrated that the smartest people we knew had no way to validate if their ideas were real. The irony isn't lost on us."

**Process Post:** "The Scafold pipeline in 60 seconds: 1. You tell us what bugs you. 2. We identify if it's a real problem. 3. We find who else has it. 4. We map existing solutions (and why they fail). 5. We design something better. 6. We give you the blueprint. Most AI tools start at step 6. We start at step 1."

**Challenge Post:** "Reply with one thing that frustrates you about your daily life. We'll pick 3 and show exactly how Scafold would turn each one into a validated business idea. No AI fluff. Real analysis."

**Milestone Post:** "1,000 frustrations collected. Here's what the data tells us about what Gen Z actually wants built: [key findings]. The takeaway? Everyone talks about innovation. Nobody talks about listening."

## ADDITIONAL LINKEDIN POST IDEAS (Tim)

**The PwC Tension:** "I'm 22. I have a signed offer from PwC. And I'm about to ask Y Combinator to let me build something instead."

**Senior Year Reality:** "Last semester at Boston College. Everyone's celebrating. I'm analyzing frustration data at 2am. Here's why I wouldn't trade it."

**ChatGPT vs. Scafold:** "Most people use ChatGPT to get answers. We built something that asks better questions. The difference is everything."

**Powerful Frustration Story:** "500 people told us their biggest frustrations. One keeps me up at night: 'I spent $50K on a coding bootcamp and still can't get hired.' That's not a complaint. That's a $10B problem."

**BC Insight:** "Boston College taught me how to write business plans. It didn't teach me how to find problems worth solving. That's what Scafold fixes."

**No AI Class:** "I'm building an AI company and I've never taken an AI class. Turns out that might be an advantage — I'm not constrained by how it's 'supposed' to work."

---

## ADDITIONAL LINKEDIN POST IDEAS (Dylan)

**The 3-Company Arc:** "I've started 3 companies. The first two failed because we built the wrong thing. Scafold exists so nobody else has to make that mistake."

**Manual to Automated:** "We spent 3 years manually guiding 500+ people through frustration-to-product. Now we're automating it with AI. Here's what we kept human — and what we didn't."

**Frustration Data as Moat:** "The most important dataset in AI isn't training data. It's frustration data. Here's why."

**International Learning:** "From Hong Kong to Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore — what I learned about universal human frustration by building across 7 countries."

**Product Decision Pivot:** "The product decision that changed everything: We stopped asking 'What's your startup idea?' and started asking 'What bugs you?' Results improved 10x."

**CEO + CFO Dynamic:** "Tim handles the numbers. I handle the product. Here's how a CEO and CFO actually build an AI company together — including the fights."

**Copilot vs. Commercial Instinct:** "Everyone's building AI copilots. We're building AI commercial instinct. One does what you ask. The other tells you what's worth asking."

**Speaker Series:** "Samsung, Stripe, OpenAI — speakers from these companies came to our events. Here's what they said about the problem we're solving."

## TIKTOK VIDEO IDEAS (Scafold Brand)

1. **"Did You Get Frustrated Today?"** — Text on screen → Tim/Dylan: "Yeah." → "What if that frustration was worth $10K?" Quick cut to scafold.ai
2. **Real Submission Read-Aloud** — Dylan reads a submission deadpan. Comedic timing. Reaction shot. "And they're absolutely right." CTA overlay.
3. **"POV: Your Frustration Is Worth More Than You Think"** — Trending audio. Text transitions showing frustration → problem → market → product. 30 seconds.
4. **"Everyone Has This Problem"** — "Bet everyone here has been frustrated by [X]." Pause. "Yeah?" → "We're turning that into a company."
5. **Trending Sound + Frustration Data** — Whatever's trending. Overlay: "1,000+ people told us what frustrates them. Here's what we found."
6. **"Tell Me I'm Not the Only One"** — "Tell me I'm not the only one who [relatable frustration]." → "You're not. And there's a business here."
7. **Duet Setup** — Post a relatable frustration. Tag people. Invite duets. Repost the best as content.
8. **"Wait, This Is Real?"** — "People are actually frustrated by [specific surprising thing]?" → "Yeah. And nobody is building for it."
9. **Product Demo Speed Run** — 30-second screencast: frustration page → type frustration → submit → "That took 3 years to build. You did it in 10 seconds."
10. **Founder Energy** — Tim: "What bugs you?" Dylan: [reads wild submission]. Both laugh. "Yeah, that's a business." Raw. Unscripted. One take.

## UGC & COMMUNITY STRATEGY

### Frustration Page as UGC Engine
- After submission: "Share your frustration" button with pre-populated social copy
- Encourage screenshots of submission confirmation
- Create "Most Popular Frustrations" leaderboard (anonymized)
- Repost best submissions as daily content

### Community Activation (500+ Existing Users)
- Email blast: "We're launching something new. You're our first 500."
- "Founding 500" badge for early supporters
- Feature their frustrations in early content
- Activate 57 growth interns as content amplifiers

### Campus Ambassador Program
- Start at Boston College, expand to Asian university networks
- Ambassador task: Get 20-30 people at your school to submit a frustration
- Incentive: Early access to full platform. Mention in YC application.
- Target: entrepreneurship clubs, CS clubs, business fraternities, student investor groups

### Micro-Influencer Strategy
- Target: Founders with 5K-50K LinkedIn followers who build in public
- Also: Productivity/self-improvement creators on IG/TikTok (10K-100K followers)
- Budget: $0 — offer early access + feature their frustration analysis
- DM approach: "Hey [name], We built something we think you'd actually find useful. It's called Scafold. One question: What bugs you? We'd love to see what you get."

## VIRAL MECHANICS

### Core Loop
Frustration submission → "Wow" moment → Share on social → Friends see → They submit → Repeat

### Content Flywheel
- Daily: 1 anonymized frustration + quick analysis
- Weekly: "Frustration Report" — aggregate trends
- Monthly: "Frustration Index" — longer-form analysis, potential media pickup
- Each piece drives back to scafold.ai for more submissions

### Cross-Platform Flow
TikTok (awareness) → frustration page (conversion) → submission (data) → Instagram story (UGC) → LinkedIn post (credibility) → more traffic → repeat

---

## CONTENT PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

### Sunday Sprint (2 hours)
1. Gather all frustration submissions from past week
2. Identify 7-10 best ones to feature
3. Outline post copy for each channel
4. Draft video concepts

- Analytics: Native platform analytics + spreadsheet
- Email: Resend or Mailchimp free tier

### Canva Templates Needed

---

## YC APPLICATION NARRATIVE

Every metric feeds the YC story:

"We collected X thousand frustrations from Y people in Z days. Here's what the data tells us about what people actually want built. This is our competitive moat. This is proof of founder-market fit and execution ability."

Use actual numbers:
- "We went from idea to 500 submissions in 72 hours."
- "Our submission rate is 30%+. That means the problem resonates."
- "We have 8,000+ real human frustrations indexed and analyzed. No other AI company has this dataset."
- "Our social growth: X% week-over-week. This proves founder-market fit."

## EXECUTION NOTES

### Real-Time Adjustments
Every post template includes [X] placeholders. Fill with ACTUAL data. Do not post generic metrics. Real numbers > vanity metrics.

### What to Do When Things Change
- **Product changes:** Post honestly. "We learned X, so we're pivoting to Y."
- **Frustration gets press:** Capitalize. Jump into conversations. Share data perspective.
- **Post doesn't perform:** Don't delete. Analyze why. Test new angle.
- **Negative comments:** Engage thoughtfully. No dunking. No defensiveness.

### Cross-Amplification
- Tim tags Dylan, Dylan tags Tim
- Scafold brand reposts/quotes both founders
- Weekly "founder check-in" where both post about same topic from different angles
  - Tim: "Here's what it means for the business"
  - Dylan: "Here's what it means for the product"
